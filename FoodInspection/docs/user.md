# User Manual  
When the user navigates to our application, they will be redirected to an index page. In the Index page there will be a home button, and about us button, and a search button. The home button will redirect the user to the home page of our application. The about us button will redirect the user to a page where the application description, background, and usefulness is displayed. The search button will redirect the user to a search query page. In this page the user has the ability to input a business name, address, zip code, category, and classification. Once the desired fields are filled with content by the user then our page will yield results based on the usersâ€™ search. The user then will be able to gather that information which will assist in making a decision regarding how safe food sources are within their community.
